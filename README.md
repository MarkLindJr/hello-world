# hello-world
The most legendary repository to ever greet you.

Hello world, just a young man here. Name's Mark. Looking for jobs, have always had an a creeping interest in coding, and
now it's time to figure out if I create something cool enough to show my friends. Don't know much of anything, except
the bare concept of HTML, so we're jumping into the deep end and seeing what we find. :)
